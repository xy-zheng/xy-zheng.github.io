## About Me
 
I received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics under the supervision of Professor [Songxi Chen](https://songxichen.com) at Peking University in June, 2022.
I joind [JD.com, Inc](https://corporate.jd.com) as a member of the DMT (Doctor Management Trainee) in July, 2022.
Currently,
I am an ML Algorithm Engineer at [JD Technology](https://www.jdt.com.cn/about) to support the technology innovations in financial risk management as well as the precision marketing.


## Research Interests

- Currently, I mainly focus on the Statistical Inference of Individual Treatment Effect, Optimal Treatment Regime, and the applications in financial risk management and precision marketing.
- I also have a wide interest in Causal learning for Out-of-distribution Prediction, Tree-based machine learning methods, and Environmental statistics.


## Education

- Ph.D. in Statistics, Guanghua School of Management, Peking University 
   
   September 2017 - June 2022
- B.S. in Statistics, School of Mathematical Sciences, Beijing Normal University

    September 2013- July 2017
