## About Me
 
I received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics under the supervision of Professor [Songxi Chen](https://songxichen.com) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) in June, 2022.
I joind [JD.com, Inc](https://corporate.jd.com) as a member of the DMT (Doctor Management Trainee) in July, 2022.
Currently,
I am an ML Algorithm Engineer at [JD Technology](https://www.jdt.com.cn/about) to support the technology innovations in financial risk management as well as the precision marketing.


## Research Interests

- Currently, I mainly focus on the statistical inference of Individual Treatment Effect, design of Optimal Treatment Regime, and their applications in financial risk management and precision marketing.
- I also have a wide interest in Causal learning for Out-of-distribution Prediction, Tree-based machine learning methods, and Environmental statistics.


## Education

- [Sep. 2017 - Jun. 2022] Ph.D. in Statistics, Guanghua School of Management, Peking University 
   

- [Sep. 2013 - Jul. 2017] B.S. in Statistics, School of Mathematical Sciences, Beijing Normal University
